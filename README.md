# lastword
Life is short, we may die anytime.  
If I'm going to die, at least let me say goodbye.  

### How it works

1. Writing down your *lastword*
2. Writing down somebody's email addresses, somebody you love.
3. Setting the date you die.
4. We will automatically send your *lastword* to these email address.  

**We will not collect any email address**
